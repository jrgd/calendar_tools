# gcal

Looking for a calendar app on Arch, i came across this link: [[https://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_34.html]] and went through the rabbit hole!

As i discovered the beauty of the bsdmainutils' calendar i also discovered how limited it is with today's use. This simple utility is made to download multiple .ics 
(iCal) feed and turn them into a text file: calendar; which is in turn used by the `calendar` command to output either today-tomorrow list, or more.

## Requirements
- `calendar` is part of bsdmainutils; it's available on AUR
- chmod +x gcal.sh
